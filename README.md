# Car Type Prediction Project

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook script (`carClass.jpynb`) predicts car types based on features like country of origin, car brand, fuel type, and car name using a RandomForestClassifier.

## Data
The dataset (`car_data.csv`) contains car information including country, brand, fuel type, and name.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone/download the repository.
2. Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
3. Open `carClass.jpynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Execute cells sequentially to run the project.
5. View frequency plots and model performance metrics.

## Files
- `car_data.csv`: Dataset with car information.
- `carClass.jpynb`: Jupyter Notebook script.

## Results
The project provides insights into car classification based on attributes and evaluates RandomForestClassifier performance.
